					Features to include in my project
					---------------------------------

gyms in chosen city

expandable/collapsable, scrollable list view (expanded by default)

in each list item:

poi title
address
button to access photos (photos via some api)
rating (rating via some api)
phone number 
website
icons next to each piece of info (see Lei Zhu's project)
a photo displayed by default that is like the street view of the building (via some api)
when list item is selected, it is made obvious by some animation (see Ben's project)

for each map marker: 

animate marker to make selected one stand out (enlarge?)
display info window upon clicking of marker


for each info window: 

same as stuff provided in list item, but no photos displayed by default and no button for photos

for the search bar: 

make it similar to Haopei's

search bar that takes in a city name or address and, upon hitting enter with city 
name entered, renders the map to display all the gyms for that particular city

display a message saying how many gyms were found (see Haopei's project)

the city defaults to my city (Madison, WI)

implement button labeled "Use Current Location" and the app will grab the current location of the user and display the appropriate results

					Integrating with Yelp API
